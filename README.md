Houdini
=======

Are you a researcher on numerical methods or physical simulation?
Houdini can make your life easier!

Developed by a group of scientists and PhD students, Houdini was designed with two objectives: make it easier to build numerical simulation applications and promote collaboration between scientists with average programming skills.

Dive in by reading the overview and when you're ready to code, read the installation guide and tutorial.


Overview
--------

Houdini was designed to make numerical simulation tasks fast and easy.

Researchers on numerical simulation have different backgrounds: physicists, engineers, mathematicians... but most of us have something in common: we are not programming experts.

Here's an informal overview of how to write an application in the Houdini framework.
